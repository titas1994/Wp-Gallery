WordPress Gallery

This plugin was written to take care of the invalid HTML that WordPress produces when using the `[gallery]` shortcode.

It does a bit more than that though.  It will integrate with many Lightbox-type scripts and allow you to do much cooler things with your galleries.  Plus, it has a couple of extra options that you can play around with.
