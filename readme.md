WordPress Gallery

This plugin was written to take care of the invalid HTML that WordPress produces when using the `[gallery]` shortcode.

It does a bit more than that though.  It will integrate with many Lightbox-type scripts and allow you to do much cooler things with your galleries.  Plus, it has a couple of extra options that you can play around with.

## Features

* Uses HTML5 `<fig>` and `<figcaption>` elements.
* Integrates with [Schema.org microdata](http://schema.org).
* Uses the `aria-describedby` attribute to make images + captions more accessible to users with disabilities.
* Validates the invalid code that WordPress spits out.
* Several options on how you want your gallery images.
* Allows multiple galleries in a single post.
* Ability to set the number of images shown in each gallery.
* Ability to exclude or include any images from your gallery.
* Doesn't load any extra CSS or JavaScript unless you choose to do so.
